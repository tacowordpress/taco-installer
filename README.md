# Taco Installer
##What does the Taco Installer do?
 * Gets the latest version of WordPress
 * Installs and sets up Taco Theme
 * Installs all necessary packages for Taco Theme to run correctly
 * Applies salts to the "wp-config.php" file
 * Adds an .htaccess boilerplate file with helpful caching code and environment variables
 * Loads database credentials from a .env file for easy setup and obfuscation (ignored in .gitignore for better security)
 
The installer also comes with a tool for adding http password authentication.
